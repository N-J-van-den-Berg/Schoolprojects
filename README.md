REPO TL:DR;

A repository is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files,
images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets – anything your project needs. We recommend including a README,
or a file with information about your project. GitHub makes it easy to add one at the same time you create your new repository.
It also offers other common options such as a license file.

BRANCHING TL:DR; 

Branching is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time.
By default your repository has one branch named master which is considered to be the definitive branch.
We use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to master.

Here at GitHub, our developers, writers, and designers use branches for keeping bug fixes and feature work separate
from our master (production)branch.
When a change is ready, they merge their branch into master.

MAKING CHANGE/COMMIT TL:DR;

On GitHub, saved changes are called commits.
Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made.
Commit messages capture the history of your changes, so other contributors can understand what you’ve done and why.

PULL REQUEST TL:DR;

Nice edits! Now that you have changes in a branch off of master, you can open a pull request.
Pull Requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub.
When you open a pull request, you’re proposing your changes and requesting that someone review
and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch.
Pull requests show diffs, or differences, of the content from both branches.
The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in green and red.

As soon as you make a commit, you can open a pull request and start a discussion, even before the code is finished.
By using GitHub’s @mention system in your pull request message, you can ask for feedback from specific people or teams,
whether they’re down the hall or 10 time zones away.
